## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project i could use the flexbox features to position the cards like the proposed layout, by creating a flex container with 3 flex itens.

By doing that i was able to centralize the cards at the ends and put change the position of the cards inside the item at the middle.
